******** PROJECT TITLE ******** 

CFWebsite

******** PROJECT OBJECTIVE ******** 

Create my first personal website

******** TECH USED ******** 

HTML, CSS, JS

******** WEBSITE LINK ******** 

https://kanaanayt.github.io/CFwebsite/

******** LINTERS USED ******** 

HTML: W3C validator (I used the website since I couldn't get it to work locally) 

CSS: I used stylelint (command line interface) from stylelint.io. 
I also failed to install the suggested linter locally.
The one I used suggested kebab-case.

******** ISSUES ******** 

Cross browser testing revealed slight changes in the way the SVG logo was rendered.

I couldn't get the window to scale small enough to get just one column (on the work.html page)

******** PROOF ********
